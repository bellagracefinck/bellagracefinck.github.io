		<h3>Voting Frequency by Education and Income Level</h3>

		<pre>This parallel categories plot displays the relationships between voting frequency, education level, and income bracket. 
	The data was sourced from fivethirtyeight.com, and all data was self-reported. 
		
	Some interesting relationships can be seen here - such as the apparently positive relationship
	between education and income, as well as education level and voting frequency.

	Of the voters who “always” vote, 834 voters went to college, 566 went to some college, and 411 went to high school or less. 
	The fact that the majority of these voters (1400) went to at least some college indicates a positive relationship 
	between high education levels and voting frequency.

	There appears to be a positive relationship between education and income level, which is visible in the thickness trends 
	of the lines that lead from the higher education blocks to the income level blocks - the thicker lines indicate a higher frequency 
	of voters who fall into those categories, and as the income level drops, the lines from higher education levels to the income brackets 
	tend to become thinner. However, there is not a significant difference between the two middle-income levels, which account for a 
	relatively large range of income ($40-$125k).

    	<h2>How did voter turnout and absentee voting change in Virginia General Elections
			from 2014 to 2022?</h2>
		<h3>% Voter Turnout vs. % Absentee Voters over Time</h3>
		<i>(Bubble Plot)</i>

    	<iframe src="bubble.html" title="Bubble Plot" width = "1000px" height = "700px"

    	frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
		<pre>This animated bubble plot compares the percent voter turnout to the percent of absentee ballots cast in general elections by year.
	Percent of absentee ballots is calculated by dividing the total absentee ballots by the total number of votes, while percent voter turnout
	is calculated by dividing the total number of votes by the total number of active voters.
	
	It is important to note that the 2020 looks remarkably different from the other years, with higher absentee ballot percentages 
	because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to quarantine and COVID precautions, in-person voting was greatly limited, so this change 
	in the data makes sense within the cultural context.

	Despite being a rather rural area, Goochland County had the highest voter turnout in both 2016, where the highest turnout percentage was 60.04% 
	and 2022, where the highest turnout was 66.38%.

	<pre>
	This choropleth map shows the voter turnout percentage by county in the 2022 election. Utilizing a map for 
	this data helps visualize geographic trends in voter turnout, and interactive elements such as the tooltip and popups
	allow for easier digestion of information, as the user can purposefully seek the information they want by clicking on the county.  

	For example, the westmost counties in Virginia had the lowest voter turnout by a significant margin, particularly when 
	compared to the northern areas. Although the voter turnouts dip somewhat in the south of central Virginia, the general trend 
	is higher voter turnout percentages in the north and in the east, which makes sense because populations are higher on the coast and by DC. 
	There are also a few fairly rural counties that have rather high voter turnout percentages in the central region of Virginia, however.
