                with the rise in generalized behavior analytics (i.e. Spotify Wrapped, the greatest intern project of all time), i am forced to engage with constant analysis of my own decisionmaking. at the time of this project, i had just come to the realization that my music taste was made up almost entirely of female artists, even in genres that are steeped in mascunline precedent, like hip hop. in what was both a continuation of my fascination with gender studies and a curiosity about why my taste was so heavily skewed, i performed a lyrical analysis of 20 of the most prolific hip hop artists of the most recent decades to see the differences in language between male and female rap artists.
