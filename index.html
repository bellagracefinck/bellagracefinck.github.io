  <h2>Ever turned on the radio at an inopportune time and accidentally blasted a barrage of curse words at the kids you're babysitting? Ever wondered to yourself, "Why on earth do they say all that @$#%?" 
  
Welcome to Female Dogs, a visual analysis of the language used by rappers in the 21st century.</h2>

<h2>It would be helpful to start at the beginning.</h2>
<pre>In the 1990s, artists like Missy Elliott, Lauryn Hill, and Lil' Kim emerged, showcasing their diverse styles and artistic talents. These artists challenged stereotypes, redefined femininity, and expanded the creative possibilities within rap music.

In recent years, women in rap have achieved even greater visibility and success. Artists like Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion, and Lizzo have achieved chart-topping hits, Grammy awards, and widespread acclaim. They have brought a fresh perspective to the genre, unapologetically expressing their sexuality, confidence, and individuality.
  
Women in rap continue to thrive, making strides in the industry while promoting diversity and representation. They have become role models for aspiring artists, proving that women can excel in rap and command the spotlight. With their powerful voices and compelling storytelling, women in rap have left an indelible mark on the genre, shaping its evolution and inspiring future generations of artists. </pre>
<br>
<h2>Why me? Why this?</h2>
<pre>I took a class through VCU during my senior year of high school called "Gender, Politics, and Consumerism in a Global Context." It was two semester-long courses, one called Cultural Texts & Contexts and one called Gender & Consumer Culture. The latter was all about analyzing media through a gendered lens. We watched movies, peeled through magazines, read lyrics, and essentially consumed any gender-related media we possibly could. It is important to note that I took this class in 2020-2021. WAP by Cardi B and Megan thee Stallion was released on August 7, 2020. My professor pulled up the lyrics and music video for my class to analyze on April 26, 2021. 

Although the instinct of the class was to laugh at this vulgar assignment, it was actually quite enlightening for me. It was the first time I had thought about the why of vulgarity, of self-sexualization - the first time I had thought about the role that language plays in our access to agency as women. 
  
When the final project was introduced, I thought it would be interesting to continue my already-piqued interest in this subject and see if I could find any interesting correlations between the gender of rappers and the type of language they use. I expanded it slightly to include different types of expletives as well as words that refer to different subjects but tried to maintain a sense of interactivity with my visualizations so that readers would be able to take a closer look if they wanted to. 
  </pre>

<div class = "container">
  <img src="general.png" alt="General Expletive Usage" class = "image">
  <pre class = "text">Make no mistake – this analysis is not meant to assert that male rappers use more “bad” language than female artists do. This graph shows the percentage of each artist’s lyrics that are made up of expletives/epithets, by gender. There is a much larger spread of expletive proportions for the female rappers, with some hitting proportions of 6.9% explicit while some had 0.2%. On average across all artists, 2.9% of rap lyrics were made up of direct references to women, sex, substances, money, or general expletives. </pre>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src = "proportionpcp.png" alt = "Specific Expletive Parallel Coordinates" class = "image">
<pre>Here is a plot of the same proportions split up by type of epithet and color-coded by gender. It’s clear that all of the rappers have different affinities for different kinds of expletives, so it would be an unfair generalization to continue in my analysis as though all female rappers have the same tendencies or goals. That being said, I will be talking about the potential contexts behind some of the common language choices in later analysis.</pre>

<h2>The B-Word</h2>
<pre>Everyone knows what it is. Maybe it was the first curse word you ever learned (like me!), maybe it’s your idea of a term of endearment, or maybe it’s your idea of a horrific insult to hurl at another human being. Regardless of its significance to any of us, the word “bitch” gets quite a lot of use in rap lyrics. 

As I looked through my findings, I was unsurprised to see that female rappers used the word more frequently than male rappers. For some of them, it was in their top ten most used words in all of their lyrics. But I knew that this frequency didn’t tell the whole story. I created a function to find the context around the “b-word” for each instance, and found the following. 
  </pre>

<div class = "subtitle-box"> 
  <pre>Male rappers used the words "<u>my</u> bitch" <b>35 times</b>
    Female rappers used the words  "<u>my</u> bitch" <b>32 times</b> </pre>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class = "subtitle-box"> 
  <pre>Male rappers used the words "<u>your</u> bitch" <b>12 times</b>
    Female rappers used the words "<u>your</u> bitch" <b>25 times</b> </pre>
</div>
